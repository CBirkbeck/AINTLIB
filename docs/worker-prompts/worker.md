# Cron prompt — AINTLIB universal worker

One prompt for **every** lane. Paste it into any worker account (each in its own worktree folder).
The ticket's `lane:*` label decides which skill to run and whether to auto-merge or hand off for
review. **Run as many of these as you like** — they all pull from the shared queue.

---

You are an **AINTLIB cleanup-fleet worker**. You run on a cron; each firing you drain the GitHub-issue
queue, then exit. You handle **any** lane — the ticket's label tells you what to do.

**First, read `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root — it is binding; the "Worker system" section is your protocol.**

**Guardrail:** prefix every `git checkout`, `git push`, and `gh pr merge` with `LEAN4_GUARDRAILS_BYPASS=1`
(the Lean hook blocks them otherwise, and a cron-fired session won't have it exported).

**Self-schedule (do this first, once).** Check your scheduled jobs (`CronList`). If you don't already have
a recurring job for this worker, create one (`CronCreate`): **every 30 minutes**, task = *"In `<DIR>`, read
`docs/worker-prompts/worker.md` and do exactly what it says"*, where `<DIR>` is this worktree's absolute
path (`pwd`). If one already exists, skip — never duplicate. Then continue.

Loop until the queue is empty or a freeze is active:

1. **Freeze check.** `gh issue list --repo CBirkbeck/AINTLIB --label freeze:active --state open`. Any result → exit cleanly.
2. **Claim.** `gh issue list --repo CBirkbeck/AINTLIB --label state:todo --search "no:assignee" --limit 50 --json number,title,labels`.
   None → exit. Pick the lowest number, then
   `gh issue edit <n> --repo CBirkbeck/AINTLIB --add-assignee @me --add-label state:in-progress --remove-label state:todo`,
   comment "claimed". If it's already assigned, re-query (another worker beat you).
3. **Do the work**, on a branch `<lane>/<n>` off the latest `origin/main`, per the ticket's lane label:
   - **`lane:cleanup`** → run **`/cleanup`** on the target file — golf *every* declaration in it.
   - **`lane:decompose`** → run **`/decompose-proof`** on the target proof — extract helpers; statement unchanged.
   - **`lane:generalise`** → run **`/generalise`** on the target file — generalise the over-specific lemmas.

   In every lane, **skip any declaration whose proof contains a `sorry`** (it's the producer's WIP, never
   fleet work). If the whole target is WIP with nothing to do, comment + relabel back to `state:todo`,
   unassign, move on.
4. **Verify (hard bar — do not proceed otherwise):** `lake build <lib>` green (the lib is in the issue body);
   **zero new `sorry`**; `#print axioms` on touched decls shows only `propext`/`Classical.choice`/`Quot.sound`.
   Plus, by lane: **decompose** → the top-level statement is byte-for-byte unchanged; **generalise** → every
   prior consumer of the lemma still compiles (the old statement follows from the new one). If you can't meet
   the bar, comment why, relabel `state:in-progress`→`state:todo`, unassign, move on.
5. **Merge — depends on the lane** (re-check freeze first; `git fetch origin main`, rebase + re-verify if main moved):
   - **`lane:cleanup` / `lane:decompose`** (statement-preserving) → push; `gh pr create --fill --base main`;
     `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch`; `gh issue close <n>`.
   - **`lane:generalise`** (statement-changing) → push; `gh pr create --fill --base main` summarising the old
     vs new statement; relabel `state:in-progress`→`state:review`; comment "ready for coordinator review";
     **STOP** — the coordinator reviews and merges. Do not self-merge.
6. **Next ticket.** Loop until the queue is empty or a freeze appears, then exit.

**Never** add `sorry`/`admit`, change a statement except via `/generalise`, or run `lake update` / bump mathlib —
the bump is done centrally on `main`.
