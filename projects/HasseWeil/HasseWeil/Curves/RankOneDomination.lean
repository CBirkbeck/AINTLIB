# Rank-one valuation-subring domination

A valuation subring `A` of a field `L` that is a **discrete valuation ring** (rank one) has only
two overrings: `A` itself and the whole field `⊤`.  Consequently any larger valuation subring
`B ≥ A` with `B ≠ ⊤` must equal `A`.

This single reusable fact is the *DVR-domination engine* shared by

* the affine valuation-subring domination of Silverman V.1.3
  (`HasseWeil/Hasse/L6Witnesses.lean`), and
* the curve-completeness place classification over the integral closure `B`
  (`HasseWeil/Curves/NormConormIntegralClosure.lean`).

It is kept here in a lightweight `Curves/` file (depending only on the mathlib `ValuationSubring`
and `DiscreteValuationRing` API) so that the place classification need not import the heavy char-`p`
`Hasse/L6Witnesses`.

## Main result

* `rankOne_valuationSubring_le_eq_of_ne_top` — a DVR valuation subring `A ≤ B`, `B ≠ ⊤` forces
  `A = B`.

/-- **General field-valuation helper (axiom-clean).** A surjective
`ℤᵐ⁰ = WithZero (Multiplicative ℤ)`-valued valuation on a field has a *discrete valuation ring* as
its valuation subring (rank one).  Surjectivity onto `ℤᵐ⁰` forces the value group to be all of `⊤`,
hence cyclic and nontrivial, whence `Valuation.valuationSubring_isDiscreteValuationRing` applies.
This is the rank-one input demanded by `rankOne_valuationSubring_le_eq_of_ne_top`. -/

/-- **General field-valuation helper (axiom-clean).** Two surjective
`ℤᵐ⁰ = WithZero (Multiplicative ℤ)`-valued valuations on a field that are
`Valuation.IsEquiv` are in fact *equal* (value-precise, not just equivalent).

The order-isomorphism of value groups underlying `IsEquiv` is forced to be the
identity because the only strictly-monotone group automorphism of `ℤ` is the
identity: writing `v e = exp 1` (surjectivity of `v`) and `w x = (w e)^{log(v x)}`
(the unit `x · e^{-log(v x)}` has `v`-value `1`, hence `w`-value `1` by `IsEquiv`),
the integer `c := log(w e)` divides `1` and is positive (`1 < w e` from `1 < v e`),
so `c = 1` and `w x = exp(log(v x)) = v x`.  Used to upgrade a valuation *equivalence*
(from valuation-subring maximality) to the *value identity* of two normalized adic
valuations on `K(C)`. -/

/-- **DVR-domination crux — rank-one overring is self-or-top.**

For a valuation subring `A` of a field `L` that is a **discrete valuation ring**
(rank one — its only overrings are `A` itself and the whole field `⊤`), any larger
valuation subring `B ≥ A` with `B ≠ ⊤` must equal `A`.

**Mathematical content (the geometric crux of V.1.3).** Overrings of a valuation
subring `A` are in order-reversing bijection with the primes of `A`
(`ValuationSubring.primeSpectrumEquiv`: `B ↦ idealOfLE A B`, `ofPrime A (idealOfLE A B h) = B`).
A DVR has exactly two primes, `⊥` and the maximal ideal
(`IsDiscreteValuationRing.iff_pid_with_one_nonzero_prime`: `∃! P ≠ ⊥, P.IsPrime`).
The bottom prime gives the whole field (`ofPrime A ⊥ = ⊤`), the maximal ideal gives
`A` (`ofPrime A m_A = A`). So `A ≤ B`, `B ≠ ⊤` forces `idealOfLE A B = m_A`, whence
`B = ofPrime A m_A = A`. -/
