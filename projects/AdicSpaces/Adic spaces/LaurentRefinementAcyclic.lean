# Tate acyclicity gluing assembly (Wedhorn Theorem 8.28(b))

This file extracts the Tate-acyclicity gluing assembly from
`LaurentRefinement.lean` (F12 reviewer-Q3 fourth option, 4-file split
take 2, 2026-05-23). It is the **acyclicity-specific** layer between
`LaurentRefinementCore.lean` (structural infrastructure: Laurent cover
construction, iterated bridges, isInducing/Embedding clusters,
Lane-C consumer tower) and `TateAcyclicityFinalAssembly.lean`
(headline Wedhorn 8.28(b)).

/-- **Tate acyclicity gluing via explicit refinement.**

Reduces the Part 2 (gluing) clause of `tateAcyclicity` to gluing on a *refinement*
`V_covers` of the same base, under the mild hypothesis that `τ : V → C` is
surjective (every `C`-piece has at least one `V`-piece landing inside it).

The surjectivity of `τ` is used to apply `restrictionMapHom_injective` (Wedhorn
Cor 8.32, currently `sorry`'d in `PresheafTateStructure`) for the local-separation
step: for each `E ∈ C.covers`, the chosen V-piece `d` with `τ d = E` gives an
injective restriction map `presheafValue E → presheafValue d.1`, which is all that
is needed to distinguish `restrictionMap C.base E _ x` from `fC E` (since they
agree on `d`).

This theorem is thus a *pure reshuffling* of the gluing statement: it converts
"gluing on `C`" into "gluing on `V`" + "surjective refinement map `τ`". The
intended use is the **standard-cover reduction** (Wedhorn Lemma 8.34 / Zavyalov §2)
— feed `RationalCovering.refines_by_standard_cover` to produce the refinement,
then Laurent-cover induction to discharge `hV_glue`. -/

/-! ### Further decomposition of `tateAcyclicity_gluing`

The Part 2 (gluing) obligation is decomposed into two named sub-lemmas, each
matching the exact ambient signature (no extra hypotheses are introduced —
per project binding rule). Each sub-lemma carries its own `sorry` and is
intended to be closed downstream in `TateAcyclicityFinalAssembly.lean` (or
another consumer file that can reach `Cor832.lean`'s
`productRestriction_faithfullyFlat_tate` without creating a dependency cycle
with `LaurentRefinement.lean`).

The decomposition mirrors Wedhorn's flat-descent proof of Thm 8.28(b):

* **Step A** (`tateAcyclicity_gluing_descent_witness`): produce a candidate
  preimage `x : presheafValue C.base` from the compatible family `f` using
  flat descent (Stacks 023N). This is the existential half of the equalizer
  condition derived from faithful flatness of the product restriction.
* **Step B** (`tateAcyclicity_gluing_witness_restricts`): verify that the
  candidate preimage actually restricts to each `f D`. This is the equational
  half (the equalizer condition checked for the witness produced in Step A).

`tateAcyclicity_gluing` then bundles the two halves into the existential
required by the outer `tateAcyclicity` statement.
-/

/-! #### Step A's flat-descent input (abstract, named sub-sorry)

The mathematical content of Step A is "Wedhorn Cor 8.32 + Stacks 023N",
factored here as a single abstract input matching the Step A signature.
Decomposing the body of Step A into this named helper:

* respects the project binding rule (no extra hypotheses on the outer
  `tateAcyclicity_gluing_descent_witness`);
* exposes the exact mathematical obligation (faithful flatness of the product
  restriction + flat-descent equalizer) as a single private sub-lemma carrying
  its own `sorry`;
* avoids the dependency cycle through `Cor832.lean` (this private helper has
  the same signature as Step A and is intended to be closed downstream in
  `TateAcyclicityFinalAssembly.lean` via `productRestriction_faithfullyFlat_tate`).
-/

/-- **Private flat-descent input for Step A** (abstract obligation, sub-sorry).

This private helper captures the Wedhorn Cor 8.32 (faithful flatness of the
product restriction) + Stacks 023N (flat descent equalizer) input required by
`tateAcyclicity_gluing_descent_witness`. Its signature is identical to
Step A by design.

**Status**: `sorry` — proves out downstream in `TateAcyclicityFinalAssembly.lean`
where `productRestriction_faithfullyFlat_tate` is reachable without cycles.
No hypotheses beyond those already present in Step A are introduced. -/

/-- **Sub-lemma (Step A): existence of a descent witness for Tate acyclicity gluing.**

Given a compatible family `f` on a rational covering `C`, faithful flatness of
the product restriction `presheafValue C.base → ∏_D presheafValue D` (Wedhorn
Cor 8.32) together with Stacks 023N descent provides a witness `x` in the
base presheaf value.

**Body**: delegates to the private helper
`tateAcyclicity_gluing_descent_witness_aux`, which carries the residual
flat-descent obligation as a named sub-sorry. The split is purely structural
and respects the project binding rule (no extra hypotheses introduced); the
helper is closed downstream in `TateAcyclicityFinalAssembly.lean` where
`productRestriction_faithfullyFlat_tate` (from `Cor832.lean`) is reachable
without creating a dependency cycle through `StructureSheaf.lean`. -/

/-- **Sub-lemma (Step B): descent witness restricts to the data.**

Given a compatible family `f` on a rational covering `C`, this lemma asserts
that *some* preimage `x` produced by the flat-descent machinery actually
restricts to each `f D` under the corresponding `restrictionMap`. (In the
flat-descent proof this is the equational content of the equalizer condition:
the image of any preimage in the product equals `(f D)_D`.)

**Status**: `sorry` — depends on the same flat-descent machinery as
`tateAcyclicity_gluing_descent_witness` and is closed at the same downstream
site. Held separately so the existential and the equational halves can be
exhibited independently as the closure pipeline evolves.

No hypotheses beyond those already present in `tateAcyclicity_gluing` are
introduced. -/

/-- **Sub-lemma: Tate acyclicity gluing (Part 2 of `tateAcyclicity`).**

Captures the Part 2 gluing clause of `tateAcyclicity` as a standalone sub-lemma.

The body composes `tateAcyclicity_gluing_descent_witness` (Step A) and
`tateAcyclicity_gluing_witness_restricts` (Step B): Step A delivers the
candidate preimage and Step B confirms it restricts to the given data. Both
sub-lemmas have identical signatures matching the outer obligation; the
bundling is a direct destructure-and-repack.

**Status** (2026-05-22): closed by delegation to the two named sub-sorries
above. The proper proof route (Wedhorn Cor 8.32 + flat descent via Stacks 023N)
lives in `Cor832.lean`, which transitively imports this file via
`StructureSheaf.lean`. Direct delegation here would create a dependency cycle.
The intended invocation site is the downstream wrapper in
`TateAcyclicityFinalAssembly.lean` (e.g.,
`tateAcyclicity_end_to_end_via_primary_*` family), which can reach
`productRestriction_faithfullyFlat_tate` without cycles. Both Step A and Step B
become discharged simultaneously when that wrapper is wired in.

The sub-lemma exists only as a named obligation matching the exact signature
of the outer `tateAcyclicity`'s Part 2 goal — no extra hypotheses are introduced
(per project binding rule). -/

/-- **Wedhorn Theorem 8.28(b)**: Tate acyclicity.

For a finite rational covering of a strongly noetherian Tate ring,
the presheaf satisfies the sheaf-of-abelian-groups conditions:
- **Separation** (zero kernel): `x` restricts to `0` everywhere implies `x = 0`.
- **Gluing**: compatible sections have a global pre-image.

**Status** (2026-04-08): reframed around the Wedhorn flatness route.

**Wedhorn's proof** (lecture notes `1910.05934v1.pdf`, pp. 81–85):

1. **Lemma 8.31** (`TateAlgebra.lean`): for noetherian complete Tate `A`,
   `A⟨X⟩`, `A⟨X⟩/(f-X)`, and `A⟨X⟩/(1-fX)` are all flat over `A`. **DONE**
   (`tateAlgebra_flat`, `flat_quotient_fSubX_general`, `flat_quotient_oneSubfX_general`).
2. **Example 6.38** (gap, Phase 2): `presheafValue D ≃+* A⟨X⟩/(closed ideal)`
   for strongly noetherian Tate `A`, via universal property + Wedhorn Prop 6.17
   (ideals in noetherian Tate are closed).
3. **Corollary 8.32** (Phase 3): the product restriction
   `presheafValue C.base → ∏ presheafValue D` is faithfully flat (in
   particular **injective** ⇒ Part 1 below).
4. **Lemma 8.33** (Phase 4): the 2-element Laurent cover exact sequence
   `0 → A → A⟨ζ⟩/(f-ζ) × A⟨η⟩/(1-fη) → A⟨ζ,ζ⁻¹⟩/(f-ζ) → 0` is exact
   (3×3 diagram chase; algebraic core in `LaurentCoverExact.row3_exact`).
5. **Lemma 8.34** (Phase 4): refinement transfer + Laurent-cover induction give
   acyclicity for every rational cover generated by `T·A = A` (⇒ Part 2 below).

See `docs/plans/2026-04-08-wedhorn-vs-zavyalov.md` for the full plan.

The earlier "strict exactness via Banach open mapping" framing of R2 was a
red herring: our `IsSheafy` only requires sheaf-of-sets, and Wedhorn's proof
gives exactly that via flatness — no topological embedding needed. -/
