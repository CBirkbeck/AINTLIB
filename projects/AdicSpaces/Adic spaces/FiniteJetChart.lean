# The nonuniform chart: `𝓐⟨W/ϖ⟩ ≅ K⟨X,Q⟩/(Q²)` and failure of stable uniformity

Source: [FJP] §3. Proposition 3.1 (verbatim): "There is a canonical isomorphism of
topological k-algebras `𝒜_in ≅ k⟨X,Q⟩/(Q²)`, `W ↦ ϖX`, `Q ↦ Q`." — where
`𝒜_in = 𝒜⟨W/ϖ⟩ = (𝒜⟨X⟩/(ϖX − W))^∧` is the completed rational localization at the datum
`(W; ϖ)`, presented by `T = {W, ϖ}`, `s = ϖ`. In our models the target ring is literally
`𝓑 = DualNumber (K⟨X⟩)`.

Key computation ((3.3)): for `y ∈ Q²𝒞` and every `n`, `y = ϖⁿXⁿ(W^{-n}y)` with
`‖W^{-n}y‖ = ‖y‖`, so `Q²𝒞` dies in the separated completion.

Corollary 3.2 (verbatim): "The ring 𝒜 is not stably uniform." — the chart is nonzero and
nonuniform: "`Q ≠ 0`, `Q² = 0`, and every element of the unbounded line `kQ` is
power-bounded, while `‖λQ‖ = |λ|`."
