# Reflection — class-number transfer in the regular-prime degenerate case

This file is the top-level *consumer* of the
`KummerToUnitQuotientInclusion.refl_via_chain_for_regular_prime`
discharge from `ReflectionBridgeChain.lean`.  Combined with the rest of
the reflection chain (`RankInequality.lean`, `Boundary.lean`,
`Final.lean`), it would yield the final `dvd_h_of_dvd_hPlus` transfer
unconditionally in the regular-prime case (i.e. when
`Subsingleton (ClassGroup (𝓞 K))`).

## The degenerate observation

For a number field `K` with `Subsingleton (ClassGroup (𝓞 K))`:

* `h K = Fintype.card (ClassGroup (𝓞 K)) = 1`,
* the injection `Cl(𝓞 K⁺) ↪ Cl(𝓞 K)` of `T044` (proved without any
  axiom) forces `Subsingleton (ClassGroup (𝓞 K⁺)))` as well, hence
  `hPlus K = 1`.

In particular, the hypothesis `(p : ℕ) ∣ hPlus K` of a `T044b`-style
transfer is **vacuously false** for any `p` prime: `p ∣ 1` would force
`p = 1`, contradicting primality.  So the regular-prime form of
`T044b` reduces to the trivial implication "from a contradiction one
may derive anything", and in particular the conclusion `(p : ℕ) ∣ h K`
holds vacuously.

## Why we still package it

This packaging serves three roles:

1. **It records the regular-prime branch as a top-level theorem.**
   Downstream users who already know they are in the regular case (e.g.
   verified small primes such as `p = 23` via
   `BernoulliFast.TwentyThree`) can dispatch to this lemma directly,
   with no `ReflectionMinusNontrivialityBridge` instantiation required.

2. **It composes cleanly with the rest of the reflection chain.**
   In the standard reflection argument, `refl_via_chain_for_regular_prime`
   discharges the Kummer-to-unit-quotient inclusion atom; the present
   lemma absorbs the *consumer side* of the same regular-prime
   discharge, closing the chain end-to-end.

3. **It documents the degenerate nature explicitly.**  The proof goes
   through `Nat.Prime.one_lt`, making the vacuity of the premise
   visible at the proof level.

## Files

* `BernoulliRegular/Reflection/Final.lean` — the bridge-driven `T044b`
  (`dvd_h_of_dvd_hPlus`).
* `BernoulliRegular/Reflection/ReflectionBridgeChain.lean` —
  `KummerToUnitQuotientInclusion.refl_via_chain_for_regular_prime`,
  the upstream regular-prime chain discharge.
* `BernoulliRegular/TotallyRealSubfield/ClassGroup.lean` —
  `classGroupMap_injective`, the unconditional `Cl(𝓞 K⁺) ↪ Cl(𝓞 K)`
  used here to propagate `Subsingleton` from `K` to `K⁺`.

Top-level transfer `p ∣ hPlus K ⟹ p ∣ h K` available *unconditionally*
when `Cl(𝓞 K)` is a subsingleton — i.e. in the strong-form regular
case for the relevant `p`-part.  Combined with the regular-prime
discharge of the Kummer-to-unit-quotient inclusion atom
(`KummerToUnitQuotientInclusion.refl_via_chain_for_regular_prime` in
`ReflectionBridgeChain.lean`), this closes the reflection chain
end-to-end without any `ReflectionMinusNontrivialityBridge`
instantiation in the regular case.

**Vacuity of the premise.**  The injection `Cl(𝓞 K⁺) ↪ Cl(𝓞 K)`
proved unconditionally in `classGroupMap_injective`
(Diekmann Prop 55) propagates `Subsingleton` from `K` to `K⁺`, so
`hPlus K = 1`; the premise `(p : ℕ) ∣ hPlus K` then forces
`(p : ℕ) ∣ 1`, contradicting `p.Prime`.  The conclusion is therefore
vacuously true and the proof simply derives a contradiction from the
premise.  The lemma is still useful as a degenerate-case dispatcher
that records the regular-prime branch at the top level. -/

When `K = ℚ(ζ_p)` (in any model — we work over a generic `K` with the
appropriate cyclotomic and CM structure, plus a numerical bridge
`heq` identifying `Fintype.card (ClassGroup (𝓞 K))` with the literal
class number of `CyclotomicField p ℚ` that `IsRegularPrime` is defined
over), regularity of `p` rules out the premise `(p : ℕ) ∣ hPlus K`
vacuously.

Internally this follows the same vacuity route as
`dvd_h_of_dvd_hPlus_of_subsingleton_class_group`: regularity gives
`p.Coprime (h K)`, which combined with `hPlus K ∣ h K` (Diekmann
Prop 55, unconditional) and `p ∣ hPlus K` would force
`p ∣ Nat.gcd p (h K) = 1`. -/
