# Curve images have Lebesgue measure zero

The image of a Lipschitz map from a 1-dimensional space into `ℂ` has 2-D Lebesgue
measure zero. This is the foundation for proving that for any open `U ⊆ ℂ` with
nonempty intersection with a continuous Lipschitz curve, there exists a point in
`U` off the curve (needed for the Cauchy integral formula trick in
`contourIntegral_eq_zero_of_nullHomologous`).

## Main results

* `volume_image_lipschitz_real_zero` — Lipschitz image of a subset of `ℝ` has
  Lebesgue measure `0` in `ℂ`.
* `exists_mem_not_mem_image_of_isOpen_of_lipschitz` — for open nonempty `U` and
  Lipschitz `f : ℝ → ℂ`, there exists `w₀ ∈ U` off `f '' s`.
