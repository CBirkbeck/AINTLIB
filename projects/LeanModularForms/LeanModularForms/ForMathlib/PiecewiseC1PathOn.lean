# Piecewise C¹ Paths on Arbitrary Intervals

This file defines `PiecewiseC1PathOn a b hab x y`, the free-interval form of a
piecewise C¹ path. The unit-interval form `PiecewiseC1Path` (defined in
`PiecewiseC1Path.lean`) is built on top of this by extending and bundling a
mathlib `Path x y`.

## Main definitions

* `PiecewiseC1PathOn a b hab x y` — a continuous function `ℝ → E` with `f a = x`,
  `f b = y`, continuous on `[a, b]`, that is `C¹` away from a finite set of breakpoints
  in `(a, b)`. The partition lives in the open interval `Ioo a b`.

## Design notes

This file deliberately does not depend on `Mathlib.Topology.Path`. The unit-interval
form `PiecewiseC1Path` extends this structure and adds a bundled `Path x y` together
with an equality witness `toPath.extend t = toFun t` on `Icc 0 1`.

We do not require the underlying carrier to be a mathlib `Path` because `Path` is
fixed to `[0, 1]` via `unitInterval`. A free-interval generalization needs a raw
`ℝ → E` with continuity on `Icc a b`.

/-- A piecewise continuously differentiable path from `x` to `y` on a free interval
`[a, b]` in a normed space.

The smoothness conditions (differentiability and continuous derivative) hold at every
point of `(a, b)` outside a finite set of breakpoints. The partition lives in the open
interval `Ioo a b` — the endpoints `a` and `b` are not partition points. -/
